<h1>Background Information</h1>
<font size="+2">
<p>My name is Casey James Williams. I am a 22 year old junior at the university of Maine at Orono. I am majoring in Business Finance.  I grew up in Massachusetts but then moved to Maine for high school.
I played football, basketball, and baseball in highschool.  I went to Thornton Academy in Saco for my first two years and then transferred to Old Orchard Beach High School.
While being a college student I like to stay busy with hobbies of snowboarding, flag football, video games and more. I have an interest in computer so designing this website was a cool project and an interesting thing to learn
